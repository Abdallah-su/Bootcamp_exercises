#exercise 1
#Write a function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate the addition and subtraction of it. And also it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call
#For example:
#def calculation(a, b):
    # Your Code
#res = calculation(40, 10)
#print(res)

def calculation(x, y):
    add = x+y
    sub = x-y
    return add, sub

result = calculation(20, 10)
print(result)
