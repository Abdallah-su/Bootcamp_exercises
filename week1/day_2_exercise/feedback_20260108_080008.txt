suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to complex sections of the code to improve readability for others.
- For Exercise 3, instead of printing the boolean values, consider using f-strings to incorporate the original comparison and the result into a more descriptive string, e.g., `print(f'5 < 3 is {5 < 3}')`.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are completed correctly, adhering to the instructions provided in the chapter content. The code addresses each requirement accurately, from printing 'Hello World' multiple times to implementing conditional logic based on user input.
- readability: The code is generally well-formatted and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive. However, adding more comments would further improve readability.
- performance: The code is efficient for the given tasks. No performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external data or operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities. Input from users is properly handled by casting to the correct type, preventing unexpected behavior.
